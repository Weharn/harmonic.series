harmonic.series

This is a program that will find the harmonic series up to a frequency threshold of 20kHz for any given musical note. It will take the note in thandard notation (i.e. G#6, A4, Eb3) and find the harmonic series in terms of frequencies. 

Then, depending on a specified parameter (merge or add) it will write a .wav file of the harmonic series. The add paramater will mean the notes are simply added sequentially; the merge paramater will mean that the notes are continually stacked on top of one another as a chord.
